#### Abstract:
<p align=" justify"> Previous research suggests that visual processing depends strongly on locomotor activity and is tuned to optic flows consistent with self-motion speed. Here, we used a binocular rivalry paradigm to investigate whether perceptual access to optic flows depends on their optimality in relation to walking velocity. Participants walked at two different speeds on a treadmill while viewing discrepant visualizations of a virtual tunnel in each eye. We hypothesized that visualizations paced appropriately to the walking speeds will be perceived longer than non-optimal (too fast/slow) ones. The presented optic flow speeds were predetermined individually in a task based on matching visual speed to both walking velocities. Additionally, perceptual preference for optimal optic flows was expected to increase with proprioceptive ability to detect threshold-level changes in walking speed. Whereas faster (more familiar) optic flows showed enhanced access to awareness during faster compared to slower walking conditions, for slower visual flows only a non-significant tendency for the analogous effect was observed. These effects were not dependent on individual proprioceptive sensitivity. Our findings concur with the emerging view that the velocity of one’s locomotion is used to calibrate visual perception of self-motion and extend the scope of reported action effects on visual awareness. </p>

#### Steps to reproduce the analysis:
- download the entire repository as a zip-file 
- open the relevant code files in the downloaded folder (not directly from R studio, as the “here” function is used for setting the directory)
- make sure that you have all the required packages installed
(they are loaded in the first chunk of each code file)
- for each code file, run the analysis chunk by chunk in sequential order.

The folder “_data” will contain both raw data files for each subject and the preprocessed data frames (the outputs from the preprocessing code files). The relevant data frames will be automatically read while running individual code files.

The folder “_figures” will contain the main and supplementary plots.

R Markdown reports (HTML files) present all the code files used along with their outputs.
